Mulberry now supports cute animal videos.

Humans respond favorably to a neotenized appearance. A neotenized appearance elicits sympathy from humans as well as protective urges. People with cuter faces are perceived to be "warmer," more honest and more employable for jobs.

Not only humans, but other "adult mammals" are hard-wired to have their "aggressive behavior" inhibited and exhibit "caring" and "nurturing" attitudes toward the appearance of "mammalian infants". [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness)
